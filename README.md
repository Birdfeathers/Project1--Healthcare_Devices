### 4. Data Analysis:
>
>>Data sets were pulled from legitimate data sites and then examined. We performed basic data cleaning steps such as renaming columns, addressing missing values, and data type consistency. Data frames were merged and analysed. Annotations were made to accompany code. We generated data visualizations to portray correlations. 
### 5. Conclusions:
>
>>Conclusions were based on the strength of correlation coefficients. The following conclusions were determined:
>
>>>There is a positive correlation between total drug sales and total death counts.
>
>>>Overall drug sales and death counts experience seasonality, with both higher in the winter.
>
>>>There is a positive correlation between total death counts and Pfizer stock prices.
